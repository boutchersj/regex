let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
let unRegex = /.un/; // Change this line
let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);

//The '.' wildcard character, also called 'period' or 'dot', like in grammar or object notation, matches every character
//It's useful if you're writing a regex that tolerates a variable in the pattern
