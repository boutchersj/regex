//This is an example of a 'positive lookahead'
//A negative lookahead uses this syntax: '(?!...)'
//This pattern checks for at least 5 letters and 2 consecutive numbers
//Lookaheads don't match the patterns they look for
//Think of it as a scout in the military. It will find and report back, but it won't interact with or otherwise engage what it reports on
//Negative lookaheads look to make sure the pattern ISN'T there. It returns the rest of the string if the pattern is not found
//Positive lookaheads return the rest of the string if the pattern IS found
