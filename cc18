//The '\w' is a 'shorthand character class' in Javascript that is equivalent to [A-Za-Z0-9_]
//It matches every upper- and lowercase character in the alphabet along with every number and the underscore '_' character
//Using this shorthand class with the global 'g' flag lets you return an array from the '.match()' method
//That array can be counted and that length will coincide with the length of the string as long as it didn't contain any extra symbols
