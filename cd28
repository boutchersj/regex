let favWord = "favorite";

//The '?' from lazy matching is used to say that the preceding character or set is 'optional'
//Since the word 'favorite' can also be spelled 'favourite' using British spelling, we want to say the 'u' is optional
//This catches the British spelling if the 'u' is present and ignores the absence of a 'u' in the American spelling
