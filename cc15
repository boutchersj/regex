// example crowd gathering
let crowd = 'P1P2P3P4P5P6CCCP7P8P9';

let reCriminals = /C+/; // Change this line

let matchedCriminals = crowd.match(reCriminals);
console.log(matchedCriminals);

//The solution to this problem needed to be a greedy regex (returns the longest match possible)
//It needed to find instances of the capital letter 'C' that occured one or more times in a 'crowd' (string of P1P2, etc.)
