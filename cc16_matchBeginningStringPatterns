//The caret '^' inside a character class [^abc] is used to make a negated character class
//Outside a character class, it's used to find a pattern if it's at the BEGINNING of the string
//So it'll find 'Cal' but only if it comes first in the string
//It returns false if the string is, say, 'Ricky and Cal both like racing.'
