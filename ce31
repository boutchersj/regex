let huhText = "This sandwich is good.";
let fixRegex = /good/; // Change this line
let replaceText = "okey-dokey"; // Change this line
let result = huhText.replace(fixRegex, replaceText);

//This is an example of a 'search and replace' algorithm
//It uses the regex to search for the word 'good' in the string, and if it finds it, it will replace it with 'okey-dokey' via the replace method
//The replace method accepts 2 arguments: (regex to search with, text to replace found search pattern with)

/*The 2nd argument can also use the capture groups to rearrange found search patterns in the string like in the freeCodeCamp's example:

"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
// Returns "Camp Code"
