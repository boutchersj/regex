let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
let userCheck = /[a-zA-z][a-zA-Z][\w*][\d$]*/; // Change this line
let result = userCheck.test(username);

//This regex I created checks usernames for certain restrictions
//[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z] checks that the username begins with 2 alphabet characters because 2-character usernames MUST BEGIN with 2 letters
//[\w*] checks for zero or more alphabetical characters after the first 2 letters because usernames must ONLY BE 2+ characters
//[\d$]* checks for zero more instances of digits at the end of the string because numbers are optional but MUST come at the end
